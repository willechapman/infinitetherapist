						<h3>Who We Are</h3>
						<p>We are a therapist owned and operated recruiting and staffing company based out of Atlanta, Georgia. Infinite Therapist was founded by Kelsey Thornton MS, OT/L. As a practicing therapist who has held many travel therapy positions throughout the United States, she consistently saw the need for quality therapist in many locations. She also encountered the frustrations many facilities faced when needing to fill vacant therapy positions quickly. Out of this need grew the Infinite Therapist concept:</p>
